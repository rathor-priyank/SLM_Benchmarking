# 🔍 Characterizing and Understanding the Performance of Small Language Models on Edge Devices

This project explores how **Small Language Models (SLMs)** perform when deployed directly on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi or smartphones. With the growing demand for private, low-latency AI applications, understanding how compact models behave in constrained environments is critical.

## 📘 Introduction

While **Large Language Models (LLMs)** have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, they are not without challenges:

- ❌ Require massive compute, memory, and energy  
- ❌ Privacy concerns when data is processed in the cloud  
- ❌ Not optimized for real-time or low-power scenarios  
- ❌ Often underperform on domain-specific queries  

This is where **Small Language Models (SLMs)** shine.

SLMs are compact neural networks — with parameters ranging from millions to a few billion — specifically optimized for edge computing. They are designed to be more efficient, sacrificing some accuracy for substantial gains in speed, memory usage, and deployment flexibility.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The goal of this project is to:

- Profile and compare SLMs on edge hardware  
- Identify key performance bottlenecks (e.g., CPU, RAM, disk I/O)  
- Understand trade-offs between model size, accuracy, and system resource usage  
- Explore feasibility of real-world deployment of SLMs on devices like Raspberry Pi

## 🛠 Key Concepts

### 📦 Edge Deployment

Instead of sending data to the cloud, **edge computing** allows models to run locally on a device — reducing latency and improving data privacy.

### ⚙️ Resource Footprint

A model's **resource footprint** includes how much **compute**, **memory**, and **energy** it consumes during inference.

### 🔧 Bottlenecks

The **bottleneck** is the most limiting resource — whether it's CPU speed, available RAM, or disk access — that restricts the model’s performance on a given device.

## 📈 Why It Matters

Understanding how SLMs perform on edge devices helps:

- Make informed decisions about model selection and deployment strategies  
- Optimize applications for battery-powered or bandwidth-limited environments  
- Improve accessibility to AI for low-resource regions or devices
